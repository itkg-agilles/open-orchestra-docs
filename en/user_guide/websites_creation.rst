Website creation
================

Open Orchestra is multisite and allows to create several websites from the same Back Office application.

So, the first first thing to do to create a new site is to go to the Back Office and fill the
website creation form found under the Administration entry of the navigation menu.
These documentation helps you to fill that form.

Name (required)
---------------

The name field is the website name and is used to generate the website identifier.

Website id (required)
---------------------

The website id can be generated by Open Orchestra from the site name or filled by the user when
creating the site.
Once the site created, this field is no more editable.
Open Orchestra verifies during the form validation that the site id does not already exist as it
must be unique among all the sites.

Aliases
-------

A site may exist in different languages, and each of this versions could have minor differences, for
instance a node could be published in English and not in French. Moreover, a site in English could be
accessed from different domains. To make the management of those problematics easier, Open Orchestra
introduces the concept of site alias.
Basically a site represents a set of site aliases sharing contents and pages, each site alias in a
single language. Multiple site aliases can be configured with the same language, if they define
different access points, eg domain + language prefix.

For instance, the site http://demo.open-orchestra.com/ exists in english and french. It presents two
site aliases:

* Scheme by default (required): http
* Domain (required): demo.openorchestra.com
* Language (required): English
* Language prefix : en
* main aliases : on

* Scheme by default (required): http
* Domain (required): demo.openorchestra.com
* Language (required): French
* Language prefix :
* main aliases : off

The website home page for english version is ``http://demo.openorchestra.com/en`` and
``http://demo.openorchestra.com`` for the french version.

See the `routing documentation`_ for further information.
